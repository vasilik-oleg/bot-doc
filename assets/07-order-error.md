# Ошибки заявок


## Группировка ошибок

Во время работы робота могут возникать ошибки при выставлении, перемещении и снятии заявок. Такие ошибки сами по себе не являются показателем неправильной работы робота. Это штатное поведение. Все ошибки, получаемые с биржи, классифицируются на несколько групп для удобства их обработки (например, на Московской бирже есть более десяти различных кодов ошибок, суть которых сводится к тому, что у клиента не хватает денег для выставления заявки). Ошибки снятия заявки чаще всего возникают тогда, когда после отправления приказа на снятие заявки и до обработки этого приказа биржей, заявка успевает пройти в сделку. Далее будут рассмотрены ошибки выставления и переставления заявок.

- **Ошибка:** Order adding error on *, error: REASON_NO_MONEY

**Что делать:** Нехватка денег на счете. Проверьте достаточно ли денег на счете для выставления заявки по данной бумаге данного объема. Торговля будет остановлена автоматически.

**Важно:** С биржи приходит много разных сообщений об ошибке выставления заявки, в роботе они сгруппированы и под ошибку REASON_NO_MONEY попадает несколько разных сообщений от биржи, например: "Account has insufficient Available Balance" и "Value of position and orders exceeds position Risk Limit". Эти сообщения присылает биржа в ответ на выставление заявки, робот сам никогда не возвращает ошибку REASON_NO_MONEY, это только сообщение с биржи. Почему приходит данное сообщение спрашивайте у соответствующей биржи. Сообщение, непосредственно пришедшее с биржи, вы можете найти в логе графической части робота.

- **Ошибка:** order adding error on *, continue trading, error: REASON_FLOOD

**Что делать:** Флуд-контроль, превышен лимит максимального разрешенного количества транзакций (удалений/снятий заявок) в секунду для данного логина или биржа прислала сообщение в духе Биржа перегружена, попробуйте позже или некоторые другие сообщения от биржи, которые говорят о том, что биржа сейчас испытывает некоторые трудности, но в принципе работает. Для данного робота совершить 30 транзакций в секунду (единица транзакционной активности Московской биржи, принятая на текущий момент) - это элементарно.

**Важно:** Часть проверок, аналогичных проверкам на бирже, робот выполняет на своей стороне, не отправляя на биржу те приказы, которые заведомо будут отклонены. Если приказ не прошел проверку на стороне робота (и на биржу не отправлялся), то к причине ошибки добавляется постфикс LOCAL, например, REASON_FLOOD_LOCAL. 

Стоит понимать, что робот копит некую очередь сообщений о транзакциях прежде чем передать их в лог на сайте. Есть некий лаг во времени, между событием и отображением информации о нем в логе.
Наличия флуда, это скорее общий признак избыточной активности. Именно на нее стоит обращать внимание, т.к. она не даст торговать в "нужный момент", если производительность логина исчерпана непродуктивными транзакциями в каждый момент времени.

- **Ошибка:** order adding error on *, continue trading, error: REASON_UNDEFINED

**Что делать:** Вы получите эту ошибку в том случае, если ошибку выставления заявки, которую присылает биржа, робот видит впервые (в документации бирж очень часто описаны не все сообщения об ошибках или их описание вообще отсутствует). В случае данной ошибки в лог графической части робота приходит сообщение, которое прислала биржа, читайте его внимательнее, абсолютно не факт что что-то не так с роботом и нужно писать в поддержку, и у бирж бывают проблемы. Если же вы понимаете что данное сообщение должно быть как-то обработано роботом, например, как REASON_FLOOD или REASON_NO_MONEY, то пишите в поддержку.

- **Ошибка:** order adding error on *, continue trading, error: REASON_PRICE_OUT_OF_LIMIT

**Что делать:** Данная ошибка означает, что цена заявки вне лимита, и это нормально, так может быть, т.к. цены бумаг в некоторых случаях рассчитываются и зависят от ваших настроек. Возможно, вам следует поменять настройки.

- **Ошибка:** order adding error on *, continue trading, error: REASON_CROSS

**Что делать:** Данная ошибка возникает когда вы пытаетесь торговать сами с собой. При возникновении данной ошибки на инструменте первой ноги, заявка не выставится, робот продолжит работу по алгоритму. При возникновении данной ошибки на инструментах второй ноги, робот попробует выставить заявку снова по новой цене, сместившись на один шаг цены вглубь своей стороны стакана, до получения 100 ошибок REASON_CROSS. Соответственно, в случае попадания на кросс типичный случай переставления второй ноги при попадании на кросс будет выглядеть так: попали на кросс , переставились с отступом в один шаг цены, стоим до срабатывания условия по стоп лоссу или таймеру. Переставляемся по стоп лоссу или таймеру, если снова попали на кросс, то ставим заявку с отступом в один шаг цены. И так 100 раз, если заявка не пройдёт в сделку раньше. Если позиция так и останется незахеджированной, то дальнейшее хеджирование будет осуществляться по hedge_sec или будет учтено в количестве следующей выставляемой заявки по второй ноге после сделки по первой ноге. 100 ошибок считаются отдельно по каждой "линии" заявок. Одной "линией" заявок считаем последовательные выставления хеджирующей заявки, после снятия предыдущей или при ошибке выставления по причине кросса предыдущей заявки. Если подряд прошло две сделки по первой ноге, и после каждой из них были выставлены отдельные хеджирующие заявки по второй ноге, то это разные "линии" заявок и ошибки для них будут считаться отдельно.


- **Ошибка:** order adding error on *, continue trading, error: REASON_ZERO_AMOUNT_TO_MULTIPLE

**Что делать:** Для некоторых бирж (к примеру Deribit) объем заявки должен быть кратным размеру лота. Перед выставлением заявки происходит округление объёма до целого числа лотов. Округление всегда происходит в меньшую сторону. Если объем выставляемой заявки меньше размера лота, то после округления объём выставляемой заявки будет равен нулю, робот видит это и возвращает ошибку. Для предотвращения подобных ошибок можно установить [Overlay](/docs/05-params-description.html#p.overlay) равным единице и выше.

**ВАЖНО!** 

Если в логе есть `Stop trading!!!` при наличии ошибки выставления заявки, то если ошибка была именно на не [Is first](05-params-description.md#s.is_first) бумаге, то включается поведение аналогичное `hard stop`, т.е. робот будет пытаться снять вообще все заявки по данному портфелю и не выставлять новые по всем бумагам. 


- **Ошибка:** CONN_NAME can not find order on exchange: sec=SEC_KEY, oNo=ORDER_NO

**Что делать:** Сообщение означает, что наша заявка, которая до сих пор была реальной заявкой, теперь просто не находится на бирже и мы не знаем ее судьбу, поэтому рекомендуется выключить торговлю, сбросить статусы заявок, сверить позы с биржей, после чего можно снова включать торговлю.
